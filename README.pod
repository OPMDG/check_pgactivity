=head2 DESCRIPTION

check_pgactivity is designed to monitor PostgreSQL clusters from Nagios. It
offers many options to measure and monitor useful performance metrics.

=over

=item B<-s>, B<--service> SERVICE

The Nagios service to run. See section SERVICES for a description of
available services or use C<--list> for a short service and description
list.

=item B<-h>, B<--host> HOST

Database server host or socket directory (default: "localhost").

=item B<-U>, B<--username> ROLE

Database user name (default: "postgres").

=item B<-p>, B<--port> PORT

Database server port (default: "5432").

=item B<-d>, B<--dbname> DATABASE

Database name to connect to (default: "template1").

B<WARNING>! This is not necessarily one of the database that will be
checked. See C<--dbinclude> and C<--dbexclude> .

=item B<-S>, B<--dbservice> SERVICE_NAME

The connection service name from pg_service.conf to use.

=item B<--dbexclude> REGEXP

Some services automatically check all the databases of your
cluster (note: that does not mean they always need to connect on all
of them to check them though). C<--dbexclude> allows to exclude any
database whose name matches the given Perl regular expression. You
can repeat this option as many time as needed.

See C<--dbinclude> as well. If a database match both dbexclude and
dbinclude arguments, it is excluded.

=item B<--dbinclude> REGEXP

Some services automatically check all the databases of your
cluster (note: that does not mean they always need to connect on all
of them to check them though). C<--dbinclude> allows to B<ONLY> check
databases whose names match the given Perl regular expression. You
can repeat this option as many time as needed.

See C<--dbexclude> as well. If a database match both dbexclude and
dbinclude arguments, it is excluded.

=item B<-w>, B<--warning> THRESHOLD

The Warning threshold.

=item B<-c>, B<--critical> THRESHOLD

The Critical threshold.

=item B<-F>, B<--format> OUTPUT_FORMAT

The output format. Supported output are: C<binary>, C<debug>, C<human>,
C<nagios> and C<nagios_strict>.

Using the C<binary> format, the results are written in a binary file (using perl
module C<Storable>) given in argument C<--output>. If no output is given,
defaults to file C<check_pgactivity.out> in the same directory as the script.

The C<nagios_strict> format is equivalent to the C<nagios> format. The only
difference is that it enforces the unit follow the strict Nagios specs: B, c, s
or %. Any unit absent from this list is dropped (Bps, Tps, etc).

=item B<--tmpdir> DIRECTORY

Path to a directory where the script can create temporary files. The
script relies on the system default temporary directory if possible.

=item B<-P>, B<--psql> FILE

Path to the C<psql> executable (default: "psql").

=item B<--status-file> PATH

Path to the file where service status information will be kept between
successive calls. Default is to save check_pgactivity.data in the same
directory as the script.

=item B<--dump-status-file>

Dump the content of the status file and exit. This is useful for debugging purpose.

=item B<--dump-bin-file> [PATH]

Dump the content of the given binary file previously created using
C<--format binary>. If no path is given, defaults to file
C<check_pgactivity.out> in the same directory as the script.

=item B<-t>, B<--timeout> TIMEOUT

Timeout to use (default: "30s"). It can be specified as raw (in seconds) or as
an interval. This timeout will be used as C<statement_timeout> for psql and URL
timeout for C<minor_version> service.

=item B<-l>, B<--list>

List available services.

=item B<-V>, B<--version>

Print version and exit.

=item B<--debug>

Print some debug messages.

=item B<-?>, B<--help>

Show this help page.

=back

=head2 THRESHOLDS

THRESHOLDS provided as warning and critical values can be raw numbers,
percentages, intervals or sizes. Each available service supports one or more
formats (eg. a size and a percentage).

=over

=item B<Percentage>

If threshold is a percentage, the value should end with a '%' (no space).
For instance: 95%.

=item B<Interval>

If THRESHOLD is an interval, the following units are accepted (not case
sensitive): s (second), m (minute), h (hour), d (day). You can use more than
one unit per given value. If not set, the last unit is in seconds.
For instance: "1h 55m 6" = "1h55m6s".

=pod

=item B<Size>

If THRESHOLD is a size, the following units are accepted (not case sensitive):
b (Byte), k (KB), m (MB), g (GB), t (TB), p (PB), e (EB) or Z (ZB). Only
integers are accepted. Eg. C<1.5MB> will be refused, use C<1500kB>.

The factor between units is 1024 bytes. Eg. C<1g = 1G = 1024*1024*1024.>

=back

=head2 CONNECTIONS

check_pgactivity allows two different connection specifications: by service, or
by specifying values for host, user, port, and database.
Some services can run on multiple hosts, or needs to connect to multiple hosts.

You must specify one of the parameters below if the service needs to connect
to your PostgreSQL instance. In other words, check_pgactivity will NOT look for
the C<libpq> environment variables.

The format for connection parameters is:

=over

=item B<Parameter> C<--dbservice SERVICE_NAME>

Define a new host using the given service. Multiple hosts can be defined by
listing multiple services separated by a comma. Eg.

  --dbservice service1,service2

=item B<Parameters> C<--host HOST>, C<--port PORT>, C<--user ROLE> or C<--dbname DATABASE>

One of these parameters is enough to define a new host. If some
parameters are missing, default values are used.

If multiple values are given, define as many host as maximum given values.

Values are associated by position. Eg.:

  --host h1,h2 --port 5432,5433

Means "host=h1 port=5432" and "host=h2 port=5433".

If the number of values is different between parameters, any host missing a
parameter will use the first given value for this parameter. Eg.:

  --host h1,h2 --port 5433

Means: "host=h1 port=5433" and "host=h2 port=5433".

=item B<Services are defined first>

For instance:

  --dbservice s1 --host h1 --port 5433

Means use "service=s1" and "host=h1 port=5433" in this order. If the service
supports only one host, the second is ignored.

=item B<Mutual exclusion between both methods>

You can not overwrite services connections variables with parameters C<--host HOST>, C<--port PORT>, C<--user ROLE> or C<--dbname DATABASE>

=back

=head2 SERVICES

Descriptions and parameters of available services.

=over


=item B<archive_folder>

Check if all archived WALs exist between the oldest and the latest WAL in the
archive folder and make sure they are 16MB. The given folder must have archived
files from ONE cluster. The version of PostgreSQL that created the archives is
only checked on the last one, for performance consideration.

This service requires the argument C<--path> on the command line to specify the
archive folder path to check.

Optional argument C<--suffix> allows you define the suffix of your archived
WALs. Useful if they are compressed with an extension (eg. .gz, .bz2, ...).
Default is no suffix.

This service needs to read the header of one of the archives to define how many
segments a WAL owns. Check_pgactivity automatically handles files with
extensions .gz, .bz2, .xz, .zip or .7z using the following commands:

  gzip -dc
  bzip2 -dc
  xz -dc
  unzip -qqp
  7z x -so

If needed, you can provide your own command that writes the uncompressed file
to standard output by using the C<--unarchiver> argument.

Optional argument C<--ignore-wal-size> skips the WAL size check. This is useful
if your archived WALs are compressed and check_pgactivity is unable to guess the
original size. Here are the commands check_pgactivity uses to guess the original
size of .gz, .xz or .zip files:

  gzip -ql
  xz -ql
  unzip -qql

Default behaviour is to check the WALs size.

Perfdata contains the number of archived WALs and the age of the most recent
one.

Critical and Warning define the max age of the latest archived WAL as an
interval (eg. 5m or 300s ).

Sample commands:

  check_pgactivity -s archive_folder --path /path/to/archives -w 15m -c 30m
  check_pgactivity -s archive_folder --path /path/to/archives --suffix .gz -w 15m -c 30m
  check_pgactivity -s archive_folder --path /path/to/archives --ignore-wal-size --suffix .bz2 -w 15m -c 30m
  check_pgactivity -s archive_folder --path /path/to/archives --unarchiver "unrar p" --ignore-wal-size --suffix .rar -w 15m -c 30m

=item B<autovacuum> (8.1+)

Check the autovacuum activity on the cluster.

Perfdata contains the age of oldest running autovacuum and the number of workers
by type (VACUUM, VACUUM ANALYZE, ANALYZE, VACUUM FREEZE).

Thresholds, if any, are ignored.

=item B<backends> (all)

Check the total number of connections in the PostgreSQL cluster.

Perfdata contains the number of connections per database.

Critical and Warning thresholds accept either a raw number or a percentage (eg.
80%). When a threshold is a percentage, it is compared to the difference
between the cluster parameters C<max_connections> and
C<superuser_reserved_connections>.

=item B<backends_status> (8.2+)

Check the status of all backends. Depending on your PostgreSQL version,
statuses are: C<idle>, C<idle in transaction>, C<idle in transaction (aborted)>
(>=9.0 only), C<fastpath function call>, C<active>, C<waiting for lock>,
C<undefined>, C<disabled> and C<insufficient privilege>.
B<insufficient privilege> appears when you are not allowed to see the statuses
of other connections.

This service supports the argument C<--exclude REGEX> to exclude queries
matching the given regular expression from the check.

You can use multiple C<--exclude REGEX> arguments.

Critical and Warning thresholds are optional. They accept a list of
'status_label=value' separated by a comma. Available labels are C<idle>,
C<idle_xact>, C<aborted_xact>, C<fastpath>, C<active> and C<waiting>. Values
are raw numbers or time units and empty lists are forbidden. Here is an example:

    -w 'waiting=5,idle_xact=10' -c 'waiting=20,idle_xact=30,active=1d'

Perfdata contains the number of backends for each status and the oldest one for
each of them, for 8.2+.

Note that the number of backends reported in Nagios message B<includes>
excluded backends.

=item B<backup_label_age> (8.1+)

Check the age of the backup label file.

Perfdata returns the age of the backup_label file, -1 if not present.

Critical and Warning thresholds only accept an interval (eg. 1h30m25s).

=item B<bgwriter> (8.3+)

Check the percentage of pages written by backends since last check.

This service uses the status file (see C<--status-file> parameter).

Perfdata contains the ratio per second for each C<pg_stat_bgwriter> counters
since last execution. Units Nps for checkpoints, max written clean and fsyncs
are the number of "events" per second.

Critical and Warning thresholds are optional. If set, they I<only> accept a
percentage.

=item B<btree_bloat>

Estimate bloat on B-tree indexes.

Warning and critical thresholds accept a comma-separated list of either
raw number(for a size), size (eg. 125M) or percentage. The thresholds apply to
B<bloat> size, not object size. If a percentage is given, the threshold will
apply to the bloat size compared to the total index size. If multiple threshold
values are passed, check_pgactivity will choose the largest (bloat size) value.

This service supports both C<--dbexclude> and C<--dbinclude> parameters.

It also supports a C<--exclude REGEX> parameter to exclude relations matching
the given regular expression. The regular expression applies to
"database.schema_name.relation_name". This allows you to filter either on a
relation name for all schemas and databases, filter on a qualified named relation
(schema + relation) for all databases or filter on a qualified named relation in
only one database.

You can use multiple C<--exclude REGEX> parameters.

Perfdata will return the number of indexes of concern, by warning and critical
threshold per database.

A list of the bloated indexes detail will be returned after the
perfdata. This list contains the fully qualified bloated index name, the
estimated bloat size, the index size and the bloat percentage.

This service will work with PostgreSQL 10+ without superuser privileges
if you grant SELECT on table pg_statistic to the pg_monitor role, in
each database of the cluster : C<GRANT SELECT ON pg_statistic TO pg_monitor;>

=item B<commit_ratio> (all)

Check the commit and rollback rate per second since last call.

This service uses the status file (see --status-file parameter).

Perfdata contains the commit rate, rollback rate, transaction rate and rollback
ratio for each database since last call.

Critical and Warning thresholds are optional. They accept a list of comma
separated 'label=value'. Available labels are B<rollbacks>, B<rollback_rate>
and B<rollback_ratio>, which will be compared to the number of rollbacks, the
rollback rate and the rollback ratio of each database. Warning or critical will
be raised if the reported value is greater than B<rollbacks>, B<rollback_rate> or
B<rollback_ratio>.

=item B<configuration> (8.0+)

Check the most important settings.

Warning and Critical thresholds are ignored.

Specific parameters are :
C<--work_mem>, C<--maintenance_work_mem>, C<--shared_buffers>,C<--wal_buffers>,
C<--checkpoint_segments>, C<--effective_cache_size>, C<--no_check_autovacuum>,
C<--no_check_fsync>, C<--no_check_enable>, C<--no_check_track_counts>.

=item B<connection> (all)

Perform a simple connection test.

No perfdata is returned.

This service ignore critical and warning arguments.

=item B<custom_query> (all)

Perform the given user query.

The query is specified with the C<--query> parameter. The first column will be
used to perform the test for the status if warning and critical are provided.

The warning and critical arguments are optional. They can be of format integer
(default), size or time depending on the C<--type> argument.
Warning and Critical will be raised if they are greater than the first column,
or less if the C<--reverse> option is used.

All other columns will be used to generate the perfdata. Each field name is used
as the name of the perfdata. The field value must contain your perfdata value
and its unit appended to it. You can add as many fields as needed. Eg.:

  SELECT pg_database_size('postgres'),
         pg_database_size('postgres')||'B' AS db_size

=item B<database_size> (8.1+)

B<Check the variation> of database sizes, and B<return the size> of every
databases.

This service uses the status file (see C<--status-file> parameter).

Perfdata contains the size of each database.

Critical and Warning thresholds accept either a raw number, a percentage, or a
size (eg. 2.5G).  They are applied on the size difference for each database
since the last execution. The aim is to detect unexpected database size
variation.

This service supports both C<--dbexclude> and C<--dbinclude> parameters.

=item B<hit_ratio> (all)

Check the cache hit ratio on the cluster.

This service uses the status file (see C<--status-file> parameter).

Perfdata returns the cache hit ratio per database. Template databases and
databases that do not allow connections will not be checked, nor will the
databases which have never been accessed.

Critical and Warning thresholds are optional. They only accept a percentage.

This service supports both C<--dbexclude> and C<--dbinclude> parameters.

=item B<hot_standby_delta> (9.0)

Check the data delta between a cluster and its hot standbys.

You must give the connection parameters for two or more clusters.

Perfdata returns the data delta in bytes between the master and each hot
standby cluster listed.

Critical and Warning thresholds are optional. They can take one or two values
separated by a comma. If only one value given, it applies to both received and
replayed data.
If two values are given, the first one applies to received data, the second one
to replayed ones. These thresholds only accept a size (eg. 2.5G).

This service raise a Critical if it doesn't find exactly ONE valid master
cluster (ie. critical when 0 or 2 and more masters).

=item B<is_hot_standby> (9.0+)

Checks if the cluster is in recovery and accepts read only queries.

This service ignores critical and warning arguments.

No perfdata is returned.

=item B<is_master> (all)

Checks if the cluster accepts read and/or write queries. This state is reported
as "in production" by pg_controldata.

This service ignores critical and warning arguments.

No perfdata is returned.

=item B<invalid_indexes>

Check if there is any invalid indexes in a database.

A critical alert is raised if an invalid index is detected.

This service supports both C<--dbexclude>  and C<--dbinclude> parameters.

This service supports a C<--exclude REGEX>  parameter to exclude indexes
matching the given regular expression. The regular expression applies to
"database.schema_name.index_name". This allows you to filter either on a
relation name for all schemas and databases, filter on a qualified named
index (schema + index) for all databases or filter on a qualified named
index in only one database.

You can use multiple C<--exclude REGEX>  parameters.

Perfdata will return the number of invalid indexes per database.

A list of invalid indexes detail will be returned after the
perfdata. This list contains the fully qualified index name. If
excluded index is set, the number of exclude indexes is returned.

=item B<is_replay_paused> (9.1+)

Checks if the replication is paused. The service will return UNKNOWN if
executed on a master server.

Thresholds are optional. They must be specified as interval. OK will always be
returned if the standby is not paused, even if replication delta time hits the
thresholds.

Critical or warning are raised if last reported replayed timestamp is greater
than given threshold AND some data received from the master are not applied yet.
OK will always be returned if the standby is paused, or if the standby has
already replayed everything from master and until some write activity happens
on the master.

Perfdata returned:
  * paused status (0 no, 1 yes, NaN if master)
  * lag time (in second)
  * data delta with master (0 no, 1 yes)

=item B<last_analyze> (8.2+)

Check on each databases that the oldest C<analyze> (from autovacuum or not) is not
older than the given threshold.

This service uses the status file (see C<--status-file> parameter) with
PostgreSQL 9.1+.

Perfdata returns oldest C<analyze> per database in seconds. With PostgreSQL
9.1+, the number of [auto]analyses per database since last call is also
returned.

Critical and Warning thresholds only accept an interval (eg. 1h30m25s)
and apply to the oldest execution of analyse.

This service supports both C<--dbexclude> and C<--dbinclude> parameters.

=item B<last_vacuum> (8.2+)

Check that the oldest vacuum (from autovacuum or otherwise) in each database
in the cluster is not older than the given threshold.

This service uses the status file (see C<--status-file> parameter) with
PostgreSQL 9.1+.

Perfdata returns oldest vacuum per database in seconds. With PostgreSQL
9.1+, it also returns the number of [auto]vacuums per database since last
execution.

Critical and Warning thresholds only accept an interval (eg. 1h30m25s)
and apply to the oldest vacuum.

This service supports both C<--dbexclude> and C<--dbinclude> parameters.

=item B<locks> (all)

Check the number of locks on the hosts.

Perfdata returns the number of locks, by type.

Critical and Warning thresholds accept either a raw number of locks or a
percentage. For percentage, it is computed using the following limits
for 7.4 to 8.1:

  max_locks_per_transaction * max_connections

for 8.2+:

  max_locks_per_transaction * (max_connections + max_prepared_transactions)

for 9.1+, regarding lockmode :

  max_locks_per_transaction * (max_connections + max_prepared_transactions)
or max_pred_locks_per_transaction * (max_connections + max_prepared_transactions)

=item B<longest_query> (all)

Check the longest running query in the cluster.

Perfdata contains the max/avg/min running time and the number of queries per
database.

Critical and Warning thresholds only accept an interval.

This service supports both C<--dbexclude> and C<--dbinclude> parameters.

It also supports argument C<--exclude REGEX> to exclude queries matching the
given regular expression from the check.

You can use multiple C<--exclude REGEX> parameters.

=item B<max_freeze_age> (all)

Checks oldest database by transaction age.

Critical and Warning thresholds are optional. They accept either a raw number
or percentage for PostgreSQL 8.2 and more. If percentage is given, the
thresholds are computed based on the "autovacuum_freeze_max_age" parameter.
100% means some table(s) reached the maximum age and will trigger an autovacuum
freeze. Percentage thresholds should therefore be greater than 100%.

Even with no threshold, this service will raise a critical alert if one database
has a negative age.

Perfdata return the age of each database.

This service supports both C<--dbexclude> and C<--dbinclude> parameters.

=item B<minor_version> (all)

Check if the cluster is running the most recent minor version of PostgreSQL.

Latest version of PostgreSQL can be fetched from PostgreSQL official
website if check_pgactivity can access it, or is given as a parameter.

Without C<--critical> or C<--warning> parameters, this service attempts
to fetch the latest version online. You can optionally set the path to
your prefered program using the parameter C<--path> (eg.
C<--path '/usr/bin/wget'>). Supported programs are: GET, wget, curl,
fetch, lynx, links, links2.

For the online version, a critical alert is raised if the minor version is not
the most recent.

If you do not want to (or cannot) query the PostgreSQL website, you
must provide the expected version using either C<--warning> OR
C<--critical>. The given format must be one or more MINOR versions
seperated by anything but a '.'.

For instance, the following parameters are all equivalent:

  --critical "9.3.2 9.2.6 9.1.11 9.0.15 8.4.19"
  --critical "9.3.2, 9.2.6, 9.1.11, 9.0.15, 8.4.19"
  --critical 9.3.2,9.2.6,9.1.11,9.0.15,8.4.19
  --critical 9.3.2/9.2.6/9.1.11/9.0.15/8.4.19

Any value other than 3 numbers separated by dots will be ignored.
if the running PostgreSQL major version is not found, the service raises an
unknown status.

Using the offline version raises either a critical or a warning depending
on which one has been set.

Perfdata returns the numerical version of PostgreSQL.

=item B<oldest_2pc> (8.1+)

Check the oldest I<two-phase commit transaction> (aka. prepared transaction) in
the cluster.

Perfdata contains the max/avg age time and the number of prepared
transactions per databases.

Critical and Warning thresholds only accept an interval.

=item B<oldest_idlexact> (8.3+)

Check the oldest I<idle> transaction.

Perfdata contains the max/avg age and the number of idle transactions
per databases.

Critical and Warning thresholds only accept an interval.

This service supports both C<--dbexclude> and C<--dbinclude> parameters.

=item B<pg_dump_backup>

Check the age and size of backups.

This service uses the status file (see C<--status-file> parameter).

The C<--path> argument contains the location to the backup folder. The supported
format is a glob pattern to match every folder or file you need to check. If
appropriate, the probe should be run as a user with sufficient privileges to check
for the existence of files.

The C<--pattern> is required, and must contain a regular expression matching
the backup file name, extracting the database name from the first matching
group. For example, the pattern "(\w+)-\d+.dump" can be used to match dumps of
the form:

    mydb-20150803.dump
    otherdb-20150803.dump
    mydb-20150806.dump
    otherdb-20150806.dump
    mydb-20150807.dump

Optionally, a C<--global-pattern> option can be supplied to check for an
additional global file.

The C<--critical> and C<--warning> thresholds are optional. They accept a list
of 'metric=value' separated by a comma. Available metric are C<oldest> and
C<newest>, respectively the age of the oldest and newest backups, and C<size>,
which must be the maximum variation of size since the last check, expressed
as a size or a percentage.

This service supports the arguments C<--dbinclude> and C<--dbexclude>, to
respectively test for the presence of include or exclude files.

The argument C<--exclude> allows to exclude files younger than the given
interval. This is useful to ignore files from a backup in progress. Eg., if
your backup process takes 2h, set this to '125m'.

Perfdata returns the age of the oldest and newest backups, as well as the size
of the newest backups.

=item B<pga_version>

Checks if this script is running the given version of check_pgactivity.
You must provide the expected version using either C<--warning> OR
C<--critical>.

No perfdata is returned.

=item B<archiver> (8.1+)

Check if the archiver is working properly and the number of WAL files ready to
archive.

Perfdata returns the number of WAL files waiting to be archived.

Critical and Warning thresholds are optional. They apply on the number of files
waiting to be archived. They only accept a raw number of files.

Whatever the given threshold, a critical alert is raised if the archiver process
did not archive the oldest waiting WAL to be archived since last call.

=item B<replication_slots> (9.4+)

Check the number of WAL files retained by each replication slots.

Perfdata returns the number of WAL that each replication slot has to keep.

Critical and Warning thresholds are optional. If provided, the number of WAL
kept by each replication slot will be compared to the threshold.
These thresholds only accept a raw number.

=item B<settings> (9.0+)

Check if the settings changed compared to the known ones from last call of this
service.

The "known" settings are recorded during the very first call of the service.
To update the known settings after a configuration change, call this service
again with the argument C<--save>.

No perfdata.

Critical and Warning thresholds are ignored.

A CRITICAL is raised if at least one parameter changed.

=item B<streaming_delta> (9.1+)

Check the data delta between a cluster and its standbys in streaming replication.

Optional argument C<--slave> allows you to specify some slaves that MUST be
connected. This argument can be used as many times as desired to check multiple
slave connections, or you can specify multiple slaves connections at one time,
using comma separated values. Both methods can be used in a single call. The
given values must be of the form "APPLICATION_NAME IP".
Either of the two following examples will check for the presence of two slaves:

  --slave 'slave1 192.168.1.11' --slave 'slave2 192.168.1.12'
  --slave 'slave1 192.168.1.11','slave2 192.168.1.12'

This service supports a C<--exclude REGEX>  parameter to exclude every result
matching the given regular expression on application_name or address ip fields.

You can use multiple C<--exclude REGEX>  parameters.

Perfdata returns the data delta in bytes between the master and every standbies
found, the number of standbies connected and the number of excluded standbies.

Critical and Warning thresholds are optional. They can take one or two values
separated by a comma. If only one value is supplied, it applies to both flushed
and replayed data. If two values are supplied, the first one applies to flushed
data, the second one to replayed data. These thresholds only accept a size
(eg. 2.5G).

=item B<table_unlogged>

Check if tables are changed to unlogged. In 9.5, you can switch between logged and unlogged.

Without C<--critical>  or C<--warning> parameters, this service attempts to fetch
all unlogged tables.

A critical alert is raised if an unlogged table is detected.

This service supports both C<--dbexclude>  and C<--dbinclude> parameters.

This service supports a C<--exclude REGEX>  parameter to exclude relations
matching the given regular expression. The regular expression applies to
"database.schema_name.relation_name". This allows you to filter either on a
relation name for all schemas and databases, filter on a qualified named relation
(schema + relation) for all databases or filter on a qualified named relation in
only one database.

You can use multiple C<--exclude REGEX>  parameters.

Perfdata will return the number of unlogged tables per database.

A list of the unlogged tables detail will be returned after the
perfdata. This list contains the fully qualified table name. If
excluded table is set, the number of exclude table is returned.


=item B<table_bloat>

Estimate bloat on tables.

Warning and critical thresholds accept a comma-separated list of either
raw number(for a size), size (eg. 125M) or percentage. The thresholds apply to
B<bloat> size, not object size. If a percentage is given, the threshold will
apply to the bloat size compared to the table + TOAST size.
If multiple threshold values are passed, check_pgactivity will choose the
largest (bloat size) value.

This service supports both C<--dbexclude> and C<--dbinclude> parameters.

This service supports a C<--exclude REGEX> parameter to exclude relations
matching the given regular expression. The regular expression applies to
"database.schema_name.relation_name". This allows you to filter either on a
relation name for all schemas and databases, filter on a qualified named relation
(schema + relation) for all databases or filter on a qualified named relation in
only one database.

You can use multiple C<--exclude REGEX> parameters.

B<Warning>: With a non-superuser role, this service can only check the tables
the given role is granted to read!

Perfdata will return the number of tables matching the warning and critical
thresholds, per database.

A list of the bloated tables detail will be returned after the
perfdata. This list contains the fully qualified bloated table name, the
estimated bloat size, the table size and the bloat percentage.

This service will work with PostgreSQL 10+ without superuser privileges
if you grant SELECT on table pg_statistic to the pg_monitor role, in
each database of the cluster : C<GRANT SELECT ON pg_statistic TO pg_monitor;>

=item B<temp_files> (8.1+)

Check the number and size of temp files.

This service uses the status file (see C<--status-file> parameter) for 9.2+.

Perfdata returns the number and total size of temp files found in
C<pgsql_tmp> folders. They are aggregated by database until 8.2, then
by tablespace (see GUC temp_tablespaces).

Starting with 9.2, perfdata returns as well the number of temp files per
database since last run, the total size of temp files per database since last
run and the rate at which temp files were generated.

Critical and Warning thresholds are optional. They accept either a number
of file (raw value), a size (unit is B<mandatory> to define a size) or both
values separated by a comma.

Threshols applied on current temp files being created AND the number/size
of temp files created since last execution.

This service works with PostgreSQL 10+ without superuser privileges but it will
not monitor live temp files.

=item B<wal_files> (8.1+)

Check the number of WAL files.

Perfdata returns the total number of WAL files, current number of written WAL,
the current number of recycled WAL, the rate of WAL written to disk since
last execution on master clusters and the current timeline.

Critical and Warning thresholds accept either a raw number of files or a
percentage. In case of percentage, the limit is computed based on:

  100% = 1 + checkpoint_segments * (2 + checkpoint_completion_target)

For PostgreSQL 8.1 and 8.2:

  100% = 1 + checkpoint_segments * 2

If C<wal_keep_segments> is set for 9.0 to 9.4, the limit is the greatest
of the following formulas:

  100% = 1 + checkpoint_segments * (2 + checkpoint_completion_target)
  100% = 1 + wal_keep_segments + 2 * checkpoint_segments

For 9.5 and above, the limit is:

  100% =  max_wal_size      (as a number of WAL)
        + wal_keep_segments (if set)

=item B<stat_snapshot_age> (9.5+)

Check the age of the statistics snapshot (statistics collector's statistics).
This probe help to detect a frozen stats collector process.

Perfdata returns the statistics snapshot age.

Critical and Warning thresholds accept a raw number of seconds.

=item B<sequences_exhausted> (7.4+)

Check all sequences assigned to a column (the smallserial,serial and bigserial types),
and raise an alarm if the column or sequences gets too close to its maximum value.

Perfdata returns the sequence(s) that may have trigger the alert.

Critical and Warning thresholds accept a percentage of the sequence filled.

=item B<pgdata_permission> (8.2+)

Check that the data directory of the instance has 700 as permission, and belongs
to the system user running postgresql currently.

Checking permission works on all Unix systems.

Checking user works only in Linux systems (it uses /proc to not add
dependencies). Before 9.3, you need to give the expected owner using the
C<--uid> argument. Without this argument, the owner will not be checked.

B<It has to be executed locally on the monitored server.>
